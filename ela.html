                It takes a long time for someone to perfect a skill. Be it art or writing, it takes tons of practice to get really good at something. In my case, I want to get better at writing. Did I improve as a writer over the past month? Yes, I improved time consistency/how long it takes me to write, improved the introduction paragraph by adding more personality and feeling, and improved on using point statements.
                <br>
                One skill that has improved over the past month is how long it takes me to write an essay. Before, it would take me a while before I was able to start writing. I would think of a theme statement, I would think it was too bad to do, and waste more of my time working on the theme statement. In my pre assessment, I wasn’t able to fully finish it. In the time given, I was only able to write 233 words. It was only the introduction and the beginning of the first paragraph. It was messy with a theme statement that I didn’t feel very strongly about, “When people have intelligence they can see through people's lies, so people with intelligence could be seen as dangerous by the people with the lies”. Yet, in my post-assessment, I was able to write 554 words. I felt way stronger about the theme statement that I chose, “those who are the most unique often get suppressed the most and hardest”. Lackluster theme statements and poor choice of time would lead to a worse and un-enjoyable essay. So, better time management and theme statements without doubt have shown improvement in my writing abilities.
                <br>
                Another skill that has improved over the past month is a more improved introduction paragraph by adding more personality and feeling. In my original, pre assessment, my introductory paragraph was very much lacking. No hook, “My theme statement is”, no transition, and no explanation for the story. With a weak intro, a reader can’t feel attached to the essay in any way. I’ve realized this very important concept and began to implement it into my post-assessment. I added a proper hook, ““This is the Government Educational Service. Your son, Richard M Jordan”, a transition, “However, those who are the most unique often get suppressed the most and hardest.”, and I’ve actually explained a bit of the book, “Examination Day written by Henry Slesar explores a futuristic world”. In an essay the introductory paragraph is often the deciding factor if someone is going to stick around to read your whole essay. My pre and post assessment, when compared, show vast improvement on intro paragraphs with adding more important details to it.
                <br>
                An additional skill that has improved over the past month is use of point statements. Point statements allow readers to really understand what you’re trying to convey. They can get a short run down of your main points by skimming the beginning of each paragraph. In my pre assessment, I didn’t have any point statements, making it hard for the reader to understand the point of my essay. However, in my post assessment, I had point statement on each paragraph, “Dickie's father often discourages Dickie's inquisitiveness”, “Rickard M Jordan is trying to show how curious and inquisitive Dickie is as soon as he’s placed in an unusual environment.”, and “This man represents the government”. The way I achieved this was thinking about it from a reader's point of view. If I don’t want to read the entire story, but still want to know the author's reasoning, I’d look at the beginning of each paragraph. By adding understanding point statements, my reasoning for my essay was easier to understand.
                <br>
                Did I improve over the past month? I improved by understanding the time it takes me to write, improving on a better introduction paragraph, and by adding point statements. These different skills have made me a better writer.
