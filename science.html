                For my term 1 portfolio choice I chose all my in school and at home assignments. During term 1, I hadn’t missed a single assignment or gotten a point taken off for any assignment. All 39 assignments, 78 points. I felt very motivated throughout the term, and was able to complete all of my assignments. Even assignments like “What is Density Lab”, “Penny Chemistry Lab”, and “Density of Liquid” which were pretty hands-on.

            <p class="paraTxt">
                For my second term 1 portfolio choice I chose my Density Lab test. The Density Lab test was a different kind of test. Instead of the average packet and pencil, we were given utilities to work with to try and figure out the density of mysterious substances, and afterward we’d have to guess what the substance was based on the evidence. I quite enjoyed this distinct change in style. Being able to use the skills we picked up during previous labs in a test taking environment was a great experience.
