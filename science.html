                For my term 1 portfolio choice I chose all my in school and at home assignments. During term 1, I hadn’t missed a single assignment or gotten a point taken off for any assignment. All 39 assignments, 78 points. I felt very motivated throughout the term, and was able to complete all of my assignments. Even assignments like “What is Density Lab”, “Penny Chemistry Lab”, and “Density of Liquid” which were pretty hands-on.

                For my second term 1 portfolio choice I chose my Density Lab test. The Density Lab test was a different kind of test. Instead of the average packet and pencil, we were given utilities to work with to try and figure out the density of mysterious substances, and afterward we’d have to guess what the substance was based on the evidence. I quite enjoyed this distinct change in style. Being able to use the skills we picked up during previous labs in a test taking environment was a great experience.

                For my first portfolio choice of term 2, I chose my Atoms Test. I decided upon choosing this specific assignment because it reflected the growth I’ve had since Term 1 and the start of Term 2. In these time periods, assessments were mostly my downfall, and I was struggling pretty hard with them because I couldn’t manage my time correctly and I couldn’t find the right times to study. Another reason why I chose this assessment was because for the first time, I was actually looking forward to this test. I felt this way since I had actually prepared beforehand by studying and keeping up with my homework. My final reason for choosing this assignment is because of the topic. The topic was about atoms, which I find really interesting and really intrigue me. I enjoy learning about different important compounds made from atoms and how just by slight changes in an atom, can make it an entirely different thing.

                For my second portfolio choice of term 2, I chose my Periodic table test. Yes, I know, another test. But if you noticed, they are both part of chemistry. I chose this test to accompany the other test because they both show how much I find a liking to chemistry. I really do find chemistry to be a very interesting section of science. The study of things so incredibly small that you can’t even see them with the naked eye or even the average microscope. Being able to understand how these tiny molecules work and interact with each other is just fascinating.

                Out of all the projects, assessments, assignments, tests, quizzes, and labs. My favorite by far is the element project. I really liked being able to choose what element since it gives a little feeling of freedom with the project. And choosing an element that relates to you can give you a boost in ideas. Elements in general are one of the most interesting and important sections in science because they are the literal building blocks of everything. Normally, in other projects, research is very boring and tedious. But with the element project, researching about elements, what they create, who discovered them, and they’re different properties was actually very interesting. And seeing everyone else's presentation was also very enjoyable.

                My second Term 3 portfolio choice, I chose the Genetics test. In the beginning of term 3, I struggled with tests in science such as the “Water cycle test” and “Wind and pressure test”, so after putting my priorities in place, I began to get ready for the next test. As soon as we wrote down our notes in class, I started to memorize the terms, Homozygous, homo = same, recessive(ff) or dominant(FF). Heterozygous, hetero = different, recessive and dominant (Ff). And when the test came I was ready and prepared. I did well on the test.
