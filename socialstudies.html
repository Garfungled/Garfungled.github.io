                Over the course of 3 terms, 13 assessments, more homework and classwork that I can count, I think I’ve greatly improved because of this challenging social studies class. My most apparent skill that has improved is reading comprehension and historic note taking. While I sometimes do get tricked up by some test questions, I think my ability to read and understand historic events and figures has improved because of the continuous note taking assignments we were given. My most challenging work was test taking during term 1 and 2. Ms.Manship brought a new level of difficulty to tests than any other class beforehand and at first I definitely struggled with this. But during term 3 I began to get better and better at taking tests and the scores support that. I remember being ecstatic getting my first 100% in Social Studies. Usually, I’d often get 100% 's here and there in previous years, but getting a 100% in Social Studies meant a lot. To me, it showed true improvement in test taking skills, I am definitely proud of that test.
