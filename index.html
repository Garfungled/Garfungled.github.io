                For my first portfolio of term 2, I chose my Atoms Test. I decided upon choosing this specific assignment because it reflected the growth I’ve had since Term 1 and the start of Term 2. In these time periods, assessments were mostly my downfall, and I was struggling pretty hard with them because I couldn’t manage my time correctly and I couldn’t find the right times to study. Another reason why I chose this assessment was because for the first time, I was actually looking forward to this test. I felt this way since I had actually prepared beforehand by studying and keeping up with my homework. My final reason for choosing this assignment is because of the topic. The topic was about atoms, which I find really interesting and really intrigue me. I enjoy learning about different important compounds made from atoms and how just by slight changes in an atom, can make it an entirely different thing.
